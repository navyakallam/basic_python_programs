## üìã Programs Included (with Methods Used)

1. **Sum of Two Numbers**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** Direct input and `+` operator  
   ‚û§ Takes two integers as input and prints their sum.

2. **Odd or Even Check**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** `if-else` condition with modulus (`%`) operator  
   ‚û§ Checks if the entered number is divisible by 2.

3. **Factorial of a Number**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** `for` loop with multiplication accumulator  
   ‚û§ Calculates factorial using iterative method (not recursion).

4. **Fibonacci Series**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** `for` loop and swapping two variables  
   ‚û§ Prints the first `n` Fibonacci numbers by updating previous values.

5. **Reverse a String**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** String slicing (`[::-1]`)  
   ‚û§ Reverses the input string using Python‚Äôs built-in slicing feature.

6. **Palindrome Check**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** String comparison  
   ‚û§ Compares original string with its reversed version to check for palindrome.

7. **Leap Year Check**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** 'if' logic based on divisibility rules  
   ‚û§ A year is a leap year if divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless divisible by 400.

8. **Armstrong Number Check**  
   ‚û§ **Method:** `while` loop, modulus (`%`), and exponentiation (`**`)  
   ‚û§ Extracts each digit, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and sums the result.
